	Built corpus of 500k rows of news titles by tokenizing, stemming and stop-words removing, vectorized them with Tf-idf, did K-means clustering and evaluated the clustering results by matching ratio.

	Performed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and keywords extracting.

	Used PCA to reduce the dimension and visualization clusters, and made predictions on the trend of clusters.
